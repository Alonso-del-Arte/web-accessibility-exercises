        <h1>Color Blindness: Red-Green</h1>
        <p>Red-green colorblindness is the most common form of colorblindness. <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness/types-color-blindness" target="_blank">According to the National Eye Institute</a>,</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The most common type of color blindness makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green.</p>
            <p>There are 4 types of red-green color blindness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Deuteranomaly</strong> is the most common type of red-green color blindness. It makes green look more red. This type is mild and doesnâ€™t usually get in the way of normal activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Protanomaly</strong> makes red look more green and less bright. This type is mild and usually doesn't get in the way of normal activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Protanopia</strong> and <strong>deuteranopia</strong> both make you unable to tell the difference between red and green at all. </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This page would be impossible to read for someone with the latter two types of red-green colorblindness.</p>
        <p>This one paragraph is filler text. It occupies space that will quite likely be replaced later with more meaningful text, unless the purpose of its placement here is to demonstrate the concept of filler text. This paragraph does not convey any particularly meaningful information.</p>
