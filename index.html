        <p>Many years ago, when I worked as a courier, I was impressed by one of the lawyers at this one firm, a blind wo&shy;man, let's call her "Joan." She had a dog in her office, and I petted her dog. Someone had to explain to me that you're not supposed to pet service dogs. That was before they made service dog vests.</p>
        <p>Joan had a secretary to herself, like all the part&shy;ners at the firm (each associate had to share a sec&shy;re&shy;tary with another associate). Still, Joan had to type up var&shy;i&shy;ous legal documents, and read doc&shy;u&shy;ments from judges and other lawyers.</p>
        <p>How do blind people like Joan navigate today's world with computers and smartphones every&shy;where? For some partially blind people, <a href="pages/screenMags.html">screen magnifiers</a> might be the answer. Com&shy;plete&shy;ly blind people like Joan might rely on <a href="pages/screenReaders.html">screen readers</a>.</p>
        <p>This one paragraph is filler text. It occupies space that will quite likely be replaced later with more meaningful text, unless the purpose of its placement here is to demonstrate the concept of filler text. This paragraph does not convey any particularly meaningful information.</p>
        <p>Surely filler text would have no impact on ac&shy;ces&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty? However, I am concerned that the standard filler text, that annoying "lorem ipsum" which I dislike for my own reasons, might be problematic for some screen readers. So here goes the standard "lorem ipsum" text:</p>
        <blockquote><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, con&shy;sec&shy;te&shy;tur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna ali&shy;qua. Ut enim ad minim ve&shy;niam, quis nostrud exer&shy;ci&shy;ta&shy;tion ullamco laboris nisi ut ali&shy;quip ex ea commodo con&shy;se&shy;quat. Duis aute irure do&shy;lor in re&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;derit in vo&shy;lup&shy;ta&shy;te velit esse cillum do&shy;lo&shy;re eu fugiat nul&shy;la pa&shy;ria&shy;tur. Ex&shy;cep&shy;teur sint oc&shy;cae&shy;cat cu&shy;pi&shy;da&shy;tat non pro&shy;i&shy;dent, sunt in cul&shy;pa qui of&shy;fi&shy;cia de&shy;se&shy;runt mol&shy;lit anim id est la&shy;bo&shy;rum.</p></blockquote>
        <p>Huh. The built-in Microsoft Edge screen reader actually does a pretty good job with the lorem ipsum nonsense.</p>
        <p>Another concern is colorblindness. The most common form of colorblindness is <a href="pages/redGreenColorBlindness.html">red-green colorblindness</a>.</p>
        <p>I take filling out <a href="pages/form.html">a form</a> for granted, it's very easy for me. But would it be as easy to fill out if I was blind?</p>
